for memory management, allocate a large block of char* memory
    - N * max size of RN object classes

new objects will be constructed using an existing allocation address
in the available memory pool. That address will then go into the used
memory pool

object freeing will move the address from the used pool to the available pool,
making sure to reset the values somehow

if the available pool is all used, a new block of memory will be allocated
with its addresses added to the available pool
