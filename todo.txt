Fix code block output for errors
Add more Expect calls

AST pruning
    - don't want to generate code for things that are never used
    - second pass over ast can mark usages

Create list of standard libary modules and functions
Create list of builtin functions

Make use of "this" string a const somewhere so it's not being typed out each time it's used
Add ability to set variable values to null as default if they are an object or callable type.
Track down all uses of RnObject::Create and make sure those objects can be garbage collected.
Add support for imported modules
Add pragma support
Move all unnecessary operator overloads onto RnObjectBase and implement there with runtime errors thrown
Add support for modules within modules
Fix issue where acceptance conditions for parsing certain things cause syntax errors to go undetected.
Add support for hadamard product operator '*'
Add support for matrix product operator '@'
AST pruning
AST type checking
AST symbol table
